## Step-by-Step

### 1. Set Up Monitoring Tools
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Track metrics for directory service health, trust status, and replication.
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Capture and review changes to the AD environment.
- **AWS Directory Service Console**: Check status and logs.  

---

### 2. Validate Trust Relationship
- Use **Active Directory Domains and Trusts** to confirm trust is established and operational.
- Run `nltest /sc_query:<TrustedDomain>` to test secure channel status.  

---

### 3. Verify User and Group Functionality
- Test user authentication from both environments.
- Confirm group membership synchronization.  

---

### 4. Check Security Policies
- Validate that Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are being applied as intended.
- Ensure password policies and MFA configurations are enforced.  

---

### 5. Compliance and Audit
- Review logs for unauthorized access attempts.
- Ensure data residency and compliance with standards (ISO, SOC, HIPAA, etc.).  

---

## Best Practices
- Enable CloudWatch alarms for failed trust validation or replication errors.
- Implement periodic automated tests.
- Document all findings and adjustments.
